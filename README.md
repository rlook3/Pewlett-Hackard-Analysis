# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

We were tasked by a large tech company, Pewlett Hackard, with determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results

- Of the 72,458 retiring employees, about 70% are senior level (50,842).
- Only 2 managers are retiring, but 18,021 engineers, assistants, and staff members are also retiring.
- A well varied group of employees at all levels are eligible for the mentorship program.
- Many of the employees eligible for the mentorship program have been with the company for close to 20 years, already giving them a good background as to how the company operates.

## Summary

Although the company has over 70k employees reaching the retirement age, the mentorship query shows that there are many others still working who are fit to fill those shoes (especially at the senior level). My suggestion would be to start the mentorship program for those who are eligible (and willing) so that a smooth transition can take place by the time people start to leave. I would run another query to see the number of new hires within the past few years so leadership can better project how long it may take to reach their current total employment again.
